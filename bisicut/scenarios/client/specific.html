                Paul is then prompted to upload a photo with his hair styled the way he likes it. He does that and then is prompted to input
                his credit card information. Paul enters in his credit card info. and clicks "SUBMIT".

                trim from this list of services Nick provides. Paul notices the prices that Nick charges and they seem to
                be inline with what Paul is used to paying for these services.
