                Tyler is in Chicago for a business meeting and just caught his reflection in the window and notices he is in dire need of
                a hair cut! In the past, Tyler has used Bisicut and been very happy with the service and results. He decides
                to use it again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tyler pulls out his smart phone and clicks on the shortcut incon for Bisicut on his home screen. He is immediately brought
                to a screen that displays a map with his current location and several hair stylists nearby that are available
                within the hour to give him a haircut. (Since Tyler is a returning customer and has previously indicated
                he is willing to pay up to $35 for a haircut, the amount defaults to $35.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Tyler decides he might want to select a stylist closer to where his meeting is going to be held, so he drags the icon that
                is indicating his current location on the map and drops the icon at the location of his meeting. Several
                new hair stlyists appear near that location. He clicks on a stylists that is only a block away from his meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                An image of the stylist, along with her name, rating, amount she charges and the address appear. Tyler clicks the "SELECT"
                button is brought to a screen that asks if he needs any other services for this visit. (There is a menu button
                that, when clicked, displays the other services offered. Tyler only needs a haircut this visit, so he clicks
                "CONTINUE".

            </p>
            <p>
                The next screen simply displays a quick overview of Tyler's appointment (type of service, stylist's name, location, $ amount).
                There is a "CANCEL" button and a "CONFIRM" button. Tyler clicks the confirm button and notices that a text
                confirmation is almost immediately sent to his phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tyler flags a taxi and is off to get his haircut! :)
