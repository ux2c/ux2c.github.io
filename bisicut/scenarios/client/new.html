                Ben's college roommate (Jack) sent Ben a referral link to Bisicut via text messaging. Ben clicks on the link and is brought
                to a page that shows his contact info. Ben confirms it is correct. Below that he is asked to create a password
                and he does.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ben is then prompted to upload a photo with his hair styled the way he likes it. He does that and then is prompted to input his
                credit card information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once Ben has completed his profile he is presented with a map. On the map his current location
                is indicated, along with several hair stylists near by that are available to cut his hair within the next
                hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ben sees a scroll bar near the bottom of the screen and notices as he slides it the $ amount entered increases
                and decreases accordingly. He decides he would like to pay up to $30 for his hair cut and adjusts the scroll
                bar accordingly. As he does this, a couple new available hair stylists appear on the map. (Originally the
                amount defaulted to $20 when he first went to the site.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Ben clicks on the icon on the map that is closest to his location. An image of the stylist, along with her name, rating,
                amount she charges and the address appear.
            </p>
            <p>
                He notices she has a 4.5 star rating and is within walking distance! Ben clicks the "SELECT" button and is brought to a screen
                that asks if he needs any other services for this visit. (There is a menu button that, when clicked, displays
                the other services offered.) Ben only needs a haircut this visit, so he clicks "CONTINUE".
            </p>
            <p>
                The next screen simply displays a quick summary of Ben's appointment (type of service, stylist's name, location, $ amount).
                There is a "CANCEL" button and a "CONFIRM" button. Ben clicks the "CONFIRM" button and notices that a text
                confirmation is almost immediately sent to his phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ben grabs his keys and is off to get his hair cut! :)
