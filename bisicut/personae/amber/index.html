                Amber has been a hair stylist for about 6 years. She has really built a good, loyal client list. Typically woman will go
                to her because a friend recommended her and usually within a few months they are sending their husband or
                boyfriend to Amber. She has a couple of clients that she styles the entire family's hair! Amber really likes
                her job and the people she meets.

                Amber has a client, Tyler, who has been a really great client of hers for about five years. Tyler travels quite often for
                his job and can be out of town for weeks at a time. Getting a haircut in a different city was something he
                dreaded!

                Amber told Tyler about Bisicut and asked if he would like her to refer him. Tyler said Bisicut sounded too good to be true,
                but would love a referral and to try it out. Amber sent Tyler a referral link via text messaging. That was about one
                year ago and Tyler has used Bisicut whenever he is traveling and needs a haircut. He has never had a bad
                haircut since using Bisicut!
