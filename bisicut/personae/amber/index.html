                Amber has been a hair stylist for about six years. She has really built a good, loyal client list. Typically woman will go
                to her because a friend recommended her and usually within a few months they are sending their husband or
                boyfriend to Amber. She has a couple of clients that she styles the entire family's hair! Amber really likes
                her job and the people she meets.

                Amber has a client, Bill, who has been a really great client of hers for about five years. Bill recently retired and he and
                his wife have plans to go to Arizona for the future winters. During his recent haircut, Bill commented to Amber
                that he's going to have to find someone in Arizona that will cut his hair like Amber does. He was not real
                confident he'd be able to do that.

                Amber told Bill about Bisicut and asked if he would like her to refer him. Bill said Bisicut sounded too good to be true,
                but would love a referral and to try it out. Amber said she would send him a referral invite via text messaging
                as soon as her shift was done.
