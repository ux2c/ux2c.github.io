                For the past 5 years, Tyler has been a very successful sales person selling pharmaceutical products. This career requires
                a lot of traveling!
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Tyler is in Chicago for a business meeting and just caught his reflection in the window and notices he is in dire
                need of a hair cut! He has a couple of hours before the meeting, so he decides to check out Bisicut and see
                who is available nearby to give him a quick haircut. Tyler has used this site in several other cities and
                each time been VERY happy with the service and results he has received. Prior to Bisicut, getting a haircut
                out of town was always such a stressful task. It was always a gamble to see if it was a good haircut or not.
                (Meeting customers with a bad haircut, always left Tyler feeling less confident.) With Bisicut, Tyler knows
                he will have a good haircut, experience and feel confident in his meeting!
