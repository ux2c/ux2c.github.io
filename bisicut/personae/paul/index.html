                Paul is a restaurant manager and about four months ago moved to the other side town with his family.

                Paul has been going to the same stylist for eight years and has been very happy. Last month he made the hour drive back to his
                old neighborhood to go to his regular stylist. Paul decided he's going to have to find a new stylist that is
                closer to his new house. Paul's schedule is just too busy with kids and his job to drive an hour for a hair
                cut and beard trim.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul decides to ask a co-worker, Curtis, where he gets his hair cut and beard trimmed. Curtis tells Paul he found his current
                stylist, Nick, on BISICUT and has been going to him for about two years and is very happy. Paul inquires
                more about BISICUT and Curtis tells him he needs a referral to use BISICUT and would be happy to give Paul one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul thanks Curtis for the referral and gets Nick's info. so he can make an appoint with Nick.
