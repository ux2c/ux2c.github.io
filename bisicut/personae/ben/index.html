                Ben is a freshman at Penn State. He started school about 2 months ago and has been busy studying and making new friends.
                Ben is in the middle of putting the finishing touches on his presentation that he is giving tomorrow when
                he realizes he needs a haircut!
            </p>
            <p>
                Ben turns to his roommate and asks if he knows of a salon nearby that he can get a haircut at yet tonight. His roommate,
                Jack, tells Ben that he uses the app Bisicut and thinks it's awesome! Jack quickly explains to Ben how the
                app works and says he can refer Ben if he wants to try it. Ben thinks this app sounds cool and gladly accepts
                the referral!
