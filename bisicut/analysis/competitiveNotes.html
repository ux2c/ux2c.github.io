    <p>I rated them on a scale of 1-10. 10 meant I was able to perform task and in a reasonable time. 0 is N/A. (At the bottom

    <h4>
        Web or App, Free - Overall, not super impressed, but liked several of the features. I thought the list of services offered
        was too long, I counted 28! Then there were sub-catagories in them. I guess it beats typing.
    </h4>
    <p>
        After app is loaded on iPad, there is a screen with 4 slides that gives you an overview of the app, complete with screen
        shots from the app. It also gives you the option to "Skip".
    </p>
    <p>
        It then asked to allow push notification? My only option was to click ok. I was then able to "Don't Allow"
    </p>
    <p>
        I clicked in the search bar and a nice screen with options to fill in location, service, date and time appeared. There was
        also an option to choose where to perform the service at: Business or Other Location. Then there was a large "Search"
        button. (When I clicked in the "Service" input area, there was a long list that appeared to narrow my search and
        there were subcatagories to narrow it even more! I clicked on Men's haircut under "Haircuts and Other")
    </p>
    <p>
        I then selected 4:00 for the apt. time. (There was a nice, easy to use scroll bar to move the date and time into an indicated
        area. It also displayed the selected fields at tome of screen. The screen took up less than half of mobile screen,
        so it was nice and compact for ease of use, without being crowded and clumsy.)
    </p>
    <p>
        I put in the city Eden Prairie and it gave me a list of places, but not just for Eden Prairie. There was a "Sort" dropdown
        with options to sort by Nearest, Highest Rated, Highest Cost and Lowest Cost. I chose Nearest as I was playing the
        senario of not familiar with the area. (There is a menu option "Professionals" where you can see a photo of stylist,
        star rating, salon they work at and the city and state location. It appeared to sort by nearest to location selected.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The list was very nice and easy to understand. In the list, it showed an image of the salon or logo, name of salon (not stylist),
        rating of the salon, city of salon location, time of apt. I had entered and amount of service. However, I specified
        4:00p as my apt. time, but was offered earlier ones in the list. I clicked on one from the map side and then got
        a "Darn, they are all booked today" page. There was a horizontal scroll calendar to pick a different day.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the app on the iPad, it came up with the list and map views side-by-side.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>On Mobile: </strong> It took me several seconds to notice there was a small, WHITE button on a mostly WHITE background,
        near the bottom of the screen. (I noticed it because it was stationary as I was scrolling.) It was labeled "Map".
        When I clicked on it I was able to view the salons by location on the map and toggle back to list view. Map view
        did not indicate my current location.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Home Page listed other catagories near the bottom, such as: Popular in Eden Prairie, Daily Deals, Popular Catagories
        and other misc. Company/App info.
    </p>

    <h4>Web app and downloaded app to iPad - seems fresh and new. Loading icon was kind of cool. All that said, I couldn't determine
        if they had a 4:00p appointment without logging in or signing up!</h4>
    <p>
        The screen to type in location was not very easy to read. Very light weight font, light grey on a white background.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interface to select location and date were small areas to click on and seemed kind of glitchy. There wasn't a place to
        enter in a time, just the day. I was able to select Men's Cut.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I entered Eden Prairie and today's date, I only got one option. When I typed in Mpls, I got 13. The various salons appeared
        above on the map with locator icons and below was a menu list with the 13 salons that scrolls horizontally. (That
        wasn't super obvious at first.) There was an image, name of salon, name of stylist, star rating, dollar amount for
        haircut and day of week I had selected in search. (Only day, not date) As you scroll, it highlighted the location
        icon on the map. I had to click salon to "View Availability".
    </p>
    <p>
        I selected the first one in the menu as it appeared to be the closest, but not completely sure as there was no mi. indicator.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, I had "Men's Cut" selected as my search option, but when I clicked on the salon, I had several options for Hair Color!
        25 items DOWN the list I FINALLY found Mens Cut and it indicated $35 for 45 minutes. I then clicked the "Book" button
        and was asked to login or signup. I still don't know if 4:00p is available OR who my stylist is. I'm out...
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a button to toggle between List view and Map view, but it wasn't obvious at first.
    </p>
    <p>
        I noticed that the star ratings were much higher on this app; serveral were up over 50 comments!

    <h4>Web app - I used mobile phone and then iPad. I searched a couple of different cities and neither list had a salon that
        I would go to. It was for men with short hair and most had designs cut into them. (I tried both "Hair Salon and Barber"
        and the lists seemed to be similar.) Also, it showed me stylists that were booked 3 days out!</h4>
    <p>
        I typed in Men's hair cut in the search field. (Right away a notice came up wanting me that "By using this site, you agree
        to the Privacy Notice and ToS." I was supposed to click the "Ok, I undertand" button. I didn't and just kept trying
        to type around it.)
    </p>
    <p>
        It gave me a list of recommended salons. In the mobile view, I didn't see a way to view a map or any indication as to how
        far away the salons were from me. In the desktop view, I was able to see the locations all piled on top of each other.
        Didn't appear to be any hover effect to determine which icon was which location. If I toggled to the "Full Screen"
        mode, the hover effect was activated. It also didn't appear to let me change my location in the "Map" area. I had
        to go back up to the top and the original search area. (I could sort by Most popular or Customer Ratings, but didn't.)
        I clicked on the first recommendation and the first available appointment was 3 days out in the afternoon. Morning
        and evenings were already filled.
    </p>
    <p>
        There were photos, star ratings, address and services and rates (with times) listed below on the recommended screen. There
        were 3 services listed with an option to "show all services" on each salon on the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        I clicked on the second recommended salon...it was a week out for next available appointment! (11:00 a.m.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The third recommendation had an appointment within a couple hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        I clicked the button with the time slot I wanted and below was the name of the stylist, the amount they charge, the time
        allowed (4:00-4:30). Then I waited, and waited, and waited. Nothing happened. I tried several different dates, times
        and salons and all "froze up" at that same place. ??? Then I tried it on the iPad and there is a button below that
        "message" I was avoiding that lets you accept the timeslot selected above. It then brought me to a screen to Log
        in or Create an account. (Able to use FB to log in.)
    </p>
    <p>
        It appears to only offer a mobile app.

    <h4>Used web app - not a fan of the color pink they chose, but this site let me select my price range! I wasn't able to find
        a "Men's" catagory, so I went with woman's wash and cut, no blow-dry. It was very comprehensive with options, search/filter
        options, etc. Several options, but I didn't feel overwhelmed. It took a couple tries to find "Haircut", but once
        in the right place, very easy to navigate.</h4>
    <p>
        This offers last minute travel deals. Savings on hotels, flights, holidays, city breaks, theatre tickets and spa.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a little confusing at first as there is are several large input fields that come up in the middle of the landing pg.
        There are several options from air, hotel, theatre, experience, etc. I chose experience as that seemed the most likely
        catagory to find a hair stylist under. For catagory I chose "Health and Beauty" from a dropdown. The locations all
        seemed to be European, so I chose London. I was then able to select my price range and then "Search". The next screen
        had a nice layout, but only showed make-up and photography options, so I had to start again to find a hairstylist.
    </p>
    <p>
        I clicked on the logo and returned to the "Home" page. I then clicked on the "Hamburger" menu icon in the upper left. That
        revealed a menu and I clicked on "Spa". I scrolled through the page and didn't see anything for a haircut (it was
        mostly spa pkgs). I then clicked in the "Search bar" on the left and a dropdown appeared and haircut was on of the
        options!
    </p>
    <p>
        I selected Haircut, London and current date. I was presented with a small map on the left with locator icons on the map and
        a list of salons on the right. Very complete list with name of salon, location, star rating, a brief description
        about the salon and then a list of services with prices and approx. time that that service would take.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was able to book a "Men's haircut" online. I was able to select the salon, then the stylist (it listed their title; manager,
        stylist, designer, etc.) and the price was indicated along with the length of the apt. time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once I selected the stylist, I was able to select the time. I had the option to add on services or continue to "Checkout".
    </p>
    <p>
        On the "Checkout" screen I was asked to provide full name, email, phone no., if this was for me or someone else, and then
        it asked for credit card info.

    <h4>
        FREE Web app - Very nice looking website! On the desktop - it has the video playing in the background at a slower speed,
        that's very similar to how I was invisioning it in my head before even starting the research. On the mobile - it's
        a darkened photo, still nice. Definately caters to men. No map, only some have star rating and no option to enter
        $ amount. Very frustrating that some of the salons listed didn't have appointments open for 2-3 days!!
    </h4>
    <p>
        Founded by 31-year-old Songe LaRon and 30-year-old Dave Salvant, SQUIRE is an app that allows users to discover barbers,
        book appointments and pay for a haircut directly from your mobile device. Users can locate barbershops in their area,
        browse customer reviews, pay and tip -- all in a few simple taps. Customers are charged a $.99 fee to book appointments
        through the app, which is added to their total upon payout. By using SQUIRE, customers simply show up, get their
        haircut, and then leave the shop without waiting in line or pulling out their wallet. Users have the option to reschedule,
        and the app also includes a tip later feature, allowing patrons to decide on a proper gratuity amount after their
        appointment is finished.
    </p>
    <p>
        Barbers who registered to join SQUIRE were previously required to pay a $99 monthly subscription fee, with the additional
        option to sell their own products directly through the mobile service by way of in-app purchases. As part of a series
        of updates to the platform, the monthly subscription fee has been waived, allowing barbers from all parts of the
        country to join free of charge. SQUIRE also completed Y Combinator's Summer 2016 accelerator program, with LaRon
        and Salvant shifting their attention toward scaling and enhancing features for both barbers and consumers.

        There were 0 barbershops in Mpls, so I selected Boston where there was only 1, I then selected Chicago and there were 5.
        Nice screen with "cards" that have an image of the barbershop in the background, the name of the barbershop, the
        address, some had star ratings and some had incons for Yelp &amp; Instagram.
    </p>
    <p>
        I clicked on one with a 5 star rating. The next screen asked if I wanted to "Choose a Barber" or "Choose a Service". Since
        my senario isn't from Chicago, I selected "Choose a Service".
    </p>
    <p>
        I now had a list of services. I selected "Appointment Haircut and Lineup Only" for $25, 30 min. (I'm not sure what the "lineup"
        is, but the price and time seemed inline with what Tyler would normally get and he didn't need a beard trim and some
        of the other options offered. When studying site further, I noticed there's an "info" button. Turns out it's a haircut,
        razor lining and warm lather.) I then scrolled down and clicked "Next". (I also noticed you are able to select several
        from the list and the teal color border appears on ones selected. Not sure that I like that feature.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The next screen had a list of Stylists and their next available time. There was a nice calendar (horizonally) at bottom that
        the stylist list scrolled behind. I selected Alex, the time slot I wanted and then "Review &amp; Book" button.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next screen requested first and last name along with phone and email address. If you scroll down a bit, you see a list
        of the charges. Mine was $25 for the service, a 20% tip was filled in ($5.00) and Taxes &amp; Fees ($1.00). Below
        that was a Tip menu where I could select $7.00, $8.00, $9.00, NONE or "Custom Tip". Below that was a "Reserve &amp;
        Pay" button. (Not sure if they would charge my credit card at this point or when that happens. ?!? I don't want to
        tip until AFTER the service, but that's me.)

        Used web app on laptop - Website is nice and clean. When you select a service from the dropdown menu, it scrolls below the

        It asks for a zipcode to search in. I tried several different ones, including the one it defaulted to and I got a

    <h4>
        Although the site starts off looking clean and fresh, it quickly looses that appeal within a couple screens along with features,
        usablity, etc. etc.! VERY frustrating to use. Never did find an open appointment. It's an acutal store, so I would
        be curious how much of their business is from walkins verses scheduled appointments.
    </h4>
    <p>
        I selected "Beauty Services" from menu on the left. (It was over half way down page.) Next I selected "Hair by Salon" option.
        (The others were skin and brows.) Next, I click the "Book Appointment" button. I typed in Eden Prairie (it didn't
        auto fill as I typed.) Selected the state (that didn't auto fill or give options).
    </p>
    <p>
        The first time I must not have noticed what the "Travel Distance" was set to, because it seemed to give me EVERY store in
        the metro and the map was zoomed WAY out, so all of the location icons were on top of each other. I went back and
        adjusted the search to 5 miles and I was given 3 locations. (It changed my distance to 10 miles!) Map was still WAY
        zoomed out, so the icons were still one on top of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        The list of the 3 salons was VERY boring and limited. No picture, just icons above the columns for Contact, Hours, Store
        Features (which had nothing to do with the service I selected) and a link to View the Services and Book Appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next screen I had to "Selcet My Service". I chose "Hair Design". There's a dropdown menu and "Clipper Cut" was the only thing
        that resembled a "Man's Haircut". I selected that. I was presented with a list of 6 stylists, their names and amount
        they charge for service. (One had a price range.) I selected Todd for $31. I was then given the opportunity to add
        a service. Next screen was a calendar to select the date. Gues what?! He doesn't have any openings!! I was given
        the next 3 days as options, but they all said "No available appointments". Why offer them to me?!
